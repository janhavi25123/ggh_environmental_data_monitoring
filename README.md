# ggh_environmental_data_monitoring
I will analyze different types of environmental data to predict tomorrow's temperature based on historical information. To ensure accuracy, I will clean and prepare the data for machine learning. I will then build a system that can make predictions based on past patterns. Additionally, I will improve the model by including more factors that affect temperature. Finally, I will develop a method to predict the temperature for the next day.

Project Steps

1. Obtain weather data from a reliable source and download it.
2. Perform data cleaning and visualization to ensure the data is accurate and understandable.
3. Develop a testing framework to evaluate the performance of the model.
4. Iterate and refine the model to improve its accuracy in predicting the desired outcomes.
5. Enhance the model by incorporating additional variables or features that may influence the predictions.
6. Implement a method to predict the desired outcomes for future observations, ensuring the model is ready for real-time or next-day predictions.
