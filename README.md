# ggh_environmental_data_monitoring
I intend to undertake the task of processing and analyzing diverse categories of environmental data to forecast the temperature for the following day, leveraging historical data. Subsequently, I will engage in data cleansing procedures to ensure the data is devoid of any inconsistencies or errors, rendering it suitable for employment in machine learning applications. I will proceed by constructing a system that can generate predictions based on historical patterns. Furthermore, I plan to augment the model by incorporating additional predictors to enhance its predictive capabilities. Ultimately, I will focus on establishing a methodology to facilitate predictions for the subsequent day.

Project Steps

1. Download weather data
2. Clean and graph data
3. Create a testing framework
4. Improve model accuracy
