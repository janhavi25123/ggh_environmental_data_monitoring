# ggh_environmental_data_monitoring
I will analyze different types of environmental data to predict tomorrow's temperature based on historical information. To ensure accuracy, I will clean and prepare the data for machine learning. I will then build a system that can make predictions based on past patterns. Additionally, I will improve the model by including more factors that affect temperature. Finally, I will develop a method to predict the temperature for the next day.

Project Steps

1. Download weather data
2. Clean and graph data
3. Create a testing framework
4. Improve model accuracy

temperature_prediction.ipynb - predict the temperature

Data: I have downloaded the dataset from NOAA, a US government agency.
